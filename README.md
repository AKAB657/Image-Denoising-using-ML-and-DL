# Image-Denoising-using-ML-and-DL
using ML and DL to create a image denoising algorithm.
type of model used is DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network)
data_generator.py is used for training the model with the images.
model.py has the main code for the ML model.
test.py is the code for testing the model with images.
